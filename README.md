# React Mobx App Boilerplate

Hey developer ðŸ‘‹

This is a repository with an example of a base application that can scale, using [Mobx](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) as state manager. 
If you want Server Side Rendered, check my other repo [React Mobx SSR Boilerplate](https://github.com/webfueler/react-mobx-ssr-boilerplate)

Some considerations were done while creating this boilerplate:
- using classes for modules (OOP) instead of functional programming (could be refactored, but this is personal preference)
- Interface based implementation (easy to swap modules at any time, different modules between server and client side if required)
- made a simple [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) configuration

## Developing
